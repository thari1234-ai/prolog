% Base case: GCD of A and 0 is A (when A > 0)
gcd(A, 0, A) :-
    A > 0.

% Recursive case: GCD of A and B
gcd(A, B, GCD) :-
    B > 0,                  % Ensure B is greater than 0
    R is A mod B,            % Calculate remainder (A mod B)
    gcd(B, R, GCD).          % Recursive call with B and the remainder

% Wrapper predicate to calculate GCD of two numbers A and B
gcd_of_two_numbers(A, B, GCD) :-
    gcd(A, B, GCD).
